            Hello! I&apos;m Ana! A software engineer, educator, and author with a passion for innovation at the intersection of technology, data science, and finance. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Currently pursuing a Bachelor&apos;s in Computer Science at the University of Osijek&apos;s Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Information Technology, where I'm a teaching assistant and avid volunteer.
<br></br>
<br></br>
I am a builderâ€”of solutions, knowledge, and communities. From tutoring and course development to inspiring leadership, I thrive on making complex ideas accessible. As an author, I strive to inform, inspire, and challenge readers to see the world from new perspectives. Through my latest book, "The Everyday Equation: How Math Shapes Our Lives", I strive to bridge the gap between theory and real-world impact.

Beyond my work in software and education, I share insights through my newsletter, podcast (Empowerment Equation), and writings on Medium and dev.to. I also lead Bright Labs, a platform dedicated to fostering innovation and empowering the next generation of tech leaders.
<br></br>
<br></br>
Always a committed volunteer and humanitarian, I believe in using leadership, technology and knowledge as forces for good. Let&apos;s connect and create something meaningful! ðŸš€
